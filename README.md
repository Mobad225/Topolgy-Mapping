# Topolgy-Mapping
Topology mapping is a partitioning technique that maps the simulated nodes to different physical nodes. In this assignment, we will use spectral clustering to partition a given network topology on the available physical nodes. The clustering technique should find the cut that minimizes the traffic between different partitions.
